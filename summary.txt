My name is Mahmoud Nasirizadeh Sadabad. I'm an It employee, IT technichean. I'm originally from Iran, but I moved to Denmark in 2014.
I love all foods, particularly Persian and all mediteranean foods, but strangely I'm repelled by almost all forms of cheese. I'm not allergic, I just hate the taste! I make an exception for cream cheese and mozarella though -I love Ghorme Sabzi that is almost our traditional food.
